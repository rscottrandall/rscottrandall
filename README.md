- 👋 Hi, I’m @rscottrandall
- 👀 I’m a UX designer interested in getting a start on front end development so I can prototype in actual code, or at least understand it better. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ?
- 📫 How to reach me  - I'm here, presumably GIT has some kind of messaging?
